# Ports Scan & Enumeration
## Ports Scan
- This is the very first time that I encounter this kind of machine, walkthrough mentioned about IPS/IDS implementation, so new lesson to learn. ALL PORTS seems response to scan.
```bash
nmap -Pn -v 192.168.110.140
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

- So nothing from above is real, have to try my luck to frequent ports like, 22, 80, 8080, 443, etc.

## Try my luck
- Tried on port 80, 8080, 443, only 80 has response (both browser and nikto)
- We have some directory structure from /.gitignore
	- /.idea/
	- /.project
	- /.buildpath
	- /.settings/
```bash
nikto -host 192.168.110.140                                                                               130 тип
- Nikto v2.1.6
