# Port Spoof
## SSH
- Since the credential from [[15 - Web Service]] seems to be the only thing that we have currently, I go trying ssh.
```bash
ssh pgibbons@192.168.110.140
kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
Connection reset by 192.168.110.140 port 22
```

```bash
ssh -v pgibbons@192.168.110.140                                                                           255 тип

```bash
nc -v 192.168.110.140 22
